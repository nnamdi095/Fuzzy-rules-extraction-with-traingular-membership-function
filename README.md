# Fuzzy-rules-extraction-with-traingular-membership-function
This is a machine learning project that makes use of fuzzy logic to extract rules from sensor data for the simulation of the heat index
using temperature and relative humidity. The [Scikit-fuzzy](https://pythonhosted.org/scikit-fuzzy/overview.html) library is used to develop the memmbership functions which are triangular.
The files included are the preprocessing, model developmenent and validation steps.
